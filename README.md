I'm an entry level developer with a weak spot for the JAMstack. I like to think about content structures, try top optimise SEO and think of ways to improve performance. I'm working a lot with GraphQL to get all the data I need from an API. But building an API of my own is something what I really like to do too. 

Working as a Digital Project Manager brought me a lot of insights about project planning and working with a development team. But it also made me realise working as a developer is the way I want to move forward. 

Besides working as a project manager I kept myself busy with several side projects. Like a full stack community platform for a local foundation, or several JAMstack based websites for friends and family. 

Before that I graduated of the Ironhack Web development Part-Time course. Learning the ways of the modern web development with writing programming languages like JavaScript (ES6), HTML, CSS and working with a full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS).</p>

  The project Fonds voor West is named after an Amsterdam-based organisation that provides grants for local initiatives. The aim of this project was to solve a problem which the "Fonds voor West" organisation was experiencing. The issue at hand was that their current platform wasn't very user friendly, and they also had a lot of issues with sharing the correct data and information with their committee members.
